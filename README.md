# C Language Journey üë®‚Äçüíª

Hi! This is my personal repository where I'm learning and practicing the C programming language. I'm still a beginner, but I'm trying to build a strong foundation by writing code regularly and doing small projects.

## üìÇ What's Inside

- **lectures/**  
  These are my notes from watching C tutorials. Each file contains the code from a lecture, with comments to help me understand what‚Äôs happening.

- **exercises/**  
  Practice problems that helped me improve my logic and understanding of C concepts like loops, functions, arrays, pointers, etc.

- **projects/**  
  Some small beginner-level projects I built using what I learned:
  - Rock Paper Scissors Game üéÆ
  - Number Guessing Game üî¢
  - Simple Calculator ‚ûï‚ûñ‚úñÔ∏è‚ûó

## üìö Why I'm Doing This

I started this journey to:
- Learn C programming properly
- Build confidence in coding
- Become comfortable using Git and GitHub

## üîß Tools I Use

- C Language (gcc compiler)
- Code Editor: VS Code
- Version Control: Git and GitHub

---

I'll keep updating this repo as I learn more.  
Thanks for checking it out! üòÑ
