This repository contains my learning journey through the C programming language.  
It includes lecture notes, exercises, and small projects as I build my understanding of core concepts.

## Structure

- 📒 `notes/`: Annotated lecture notes with example code
- 💪 `exercises/`: Small practice problems for key concepts
- 🛠️ `projects/`: Mini-projects like Guessing Game, RPS, Calculator, etc.
